# U.S-States-map-quiz-game
The U.S. States Map Quiz Game will be a command-line interface (CLI) application where users are presented with a U.S. map's outline and asked to identify and locate specific states. Users will type in the state's name, and the program will check if their answer is correct.
Key Components:

    U.S. Map Data:
        You'll need data representing the outline of each state in the U.S. You can find this data in various formats like GeoJSON, SVG, or shapefiles.
    Python Libraries:
        You can use Python libraries such as Pandas and Turtle.
    User Interface:
        Develop a CLI interface to display the map and accept user input.
    Game Logic:
        Randomly select states for each question.
        Keep track of the user's score and display it at the end of the game.
    User Input and Validation:
        Accept user input for identifying the state.
        Validate the input to ensure it matches the correct state name.

User Input and Validation:

    Accept user input for identifying the state.
    Validate the input to ensure it matches the correct state name.

This project will provide a fun and educational way for users to learn and test their knowledge of U.S. states, while also serving as a valuable addition to your GitHub portfolio.
